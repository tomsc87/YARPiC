// Hello, you lovely people. I added some more features to my Yet Another Raspberry Pi Case (YARPiC), and decided to release a customizable source code for you.

// To make it as simple as possible, I've split it into two parts: 1) a customizer (this document), and 2) another file that does all the hard work (maths/yarpic_model.scad). If I've done my job correctly, you shouldn't need to touch the latter (and see how much of a mess my coding is).

// Anyway, I hope you find this easy to use and post your makes to Thingiverse. If you have any comments, complaints, or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment (here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3464513, or here: http://github.com/tomsc87/YARPiC).

/*[Main]*/

// Moves the ports around for different models.
model="pi3b"; //[pi3b:Paspberry Pi 1 B+/2 B/3 B/3 B+/Tinker Board,pi4:Paspberry Pi 4 B,pi3a:Paspberry Pi 1A+/3A+]

// Render both top and bottom, or just top or bottom.
part="both"; // [both:Both,bottom:Bottom,top:Top]

// For bevelled top and bottom edges. This seriously reduces performance, so change this last if you want bevelled edges.
bevel="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// This re-adds the corners from my original design and removes the through-board screw holes to hold the top in place. This cannot be used with the V-slot mounting rail.
corners="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// If using corners, set the layer height you plan to print at so a single layer gets printed above the nut housing as a base for the screw holes. You can use a drill or small circular file to remove it in post processing. If not using corners, this doesn't need to be set.
layer_height=0.2;

// Increase to add smoothness (slow render); decrease to reduce smoothness (fast render). Default is "24".
$fn=24;

/*[Bottom]*/

// Add cooling slots on the rear (microSD side) wall.
cooling_slots="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// Adds a 75*75 and 100*100 VESA mount to the bottom of the case. The 100*100 works with corners, but the 75*75 might be a bit close (I haven't actually tested it yet). Also, cannot be used with rail.
vesa="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// Adds mounting holes for 2020 aluminium (aluminum) extrusion V-slot so you can mount the case to a 3D printer that uses V-slots such as the Creality Ender 3 and Geeetech A10(M)/A20(M)/A30(M).
rail="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// Thingiverse user mikegi wanted the option to have the SD card covered, so here it is.
sd_card="yes"; //[yes:Yes,no:No]

/*[Top]*/

// Adds access to GPIO header through lid. This will also offset the fan slightly (if fan is enabled).
gpio="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// Adds fan hole on lid.
fan="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// Change fan size. It should work for any size fan (assuming it fits in the case); however, I've only tried it with the sizes that are listed. Input should be in millimetres between "25" and "40".
fan_size=40; //[25,30,40]

// This option allows you to fully embed the corner screws for a cleaner look. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with the fan screws.
full_embed="no"; //[yes:Yes,no:No]

/*[Text options]*/

// Add text. Pretty obvious, right?
add_text="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// Whatever you put in the quotation marks will appear on the top of the case.
line1="YourTextHere1";

// Same as above. However, you can leave this blank for just a single line.
line2="YourTextHere2"; 

// Check "Help > Font List" to see all available fonts (try "Chiller"; it's my favourite). (I might add a dropdown font list in future revisions.)
font="";

// This is pretty obvious.
text_size=6.5; //[5,5.5,6,6.5,7,7.5,8,8.5,9,9.5,10,10.5,11,11.5,12]

// This rotates your text 180 degrees on the Z axis so whether you have your case port-side-forward ("No") or microSD-side-forward ("Yes"), the text will appear the right way round.
flip_text="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

// This adds a dual colour option for text. Obviously, you have to render this separately from everything else.
dc_text="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]

/*[Test]*/

// After changing hotend and nozzle on my printer, I was having problems with the screw holes for the top not being tight enough to grip the screws. Instead of printing out a new top every time, I made a test to get the right size.
// Print this out and then change the variable "screw_hole" if your screws are too tight (increase the variable) or too loose (decrease the variable) until the screws fit snugly.
screwtest="no"; //[no:No,yes:Yes]
screw_hole=2.75;
